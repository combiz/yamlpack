## Installation

You can install the released version of yamlpack from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("yamlpack")
```

Or the development version from: -

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("combiz/yamlpack")
```


## Example

The complete set of package names and sources currently installed can be written to a YAML file using `write_yamlpack()`: -

```{r write_example}
library(yamlpack)
write_yamlpack()
```

A YAML file previously saved with `write_yamlpack()` can be read using `read_yamlpack()`: -

```{r read_example}
read_yamlpack()
```
